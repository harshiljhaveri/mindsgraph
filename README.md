### The Y-axis represents the number of messages concerning Doge or Shiba Inu coins in the Count graph
### In the Sentiment graph, the Y-axis represents the average level of positive sentiment for all messages through the day, computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive)
